MODULE 4 – RECOMMENDATION SCORES

1. AIM: To calculate recommendation scores for different customer segments and products using Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm with reduced matrix multiplication operations.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In an online shopping platform, recommendation scores are calculated for every product based on customer segment preferences.

The calculation is performed using:

C = A × B

Where:

A represents the segment–feature preference matrix. B represents the feature–product matrix. C represents the final recommendation score matrix. In production, both matrices are of size 1024 × 1024.

Conventional matrix multiplication requires a large number of scalar multiplication operations. Therefore, Strassen's algorithm is selected to reduce the number of multiplications.

3. ALGORITHM USED: Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
Strassen's algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to multiply two square matrices efficiently.

It divides each matrix into four smaller submatrices and uses seven multiplication operations instead of eight recursive multiplications.

It also uses matrix additions and subtractions to calculate the final result.

4. WORKING PRINCIPLE: Strassen's algorithm works using three main steps:

1. Divide:

Divide matrix A into four submatrices. Divide matrix B into four submatrices. Each submatrix contains one-fourth of the original matrix elements. 2. Conquer: Calculate seven products:

M1 = (A11 + A22) × (B11 + B22)

M2 = (A21 + A22) × B11

M3 = A11 × (B12 - B22)

M4 = A22 × (B21 - B11)

M5 = (A11 + A12) × B22

M6 = (A21 - A11) × (B11 + B12)

M7 = (A12 - A22) × (B21 + B22)

2. Combine:
Calculate the four result submatrices:

C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7

C12 = M3 + M5

C21 = M2 + M4

C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6

Combine the four submatrices to obtain the final matrix C.
