MODULE 1 – NIGHTLY ORDER CONSOLIDATION

1. AIM: To sort customer orders based on their timestamps using the Merge Sort algorithm while maintaining the original arrival order of orders having equal timestamps.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In an online ordering platform, several customer orders may arrive at different times. The system must arrange all orders in ascending order of timestamps for generating audit reports.

When two or more orders have the same timestamp, their original arrival order must be maintained. Therefore, a stable sorting algorithm is required.

3. ALGORITHM USED :Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the given list into smaller parts, sorts them individually and combines them to produce a sorted list.

It is a stable sorting algorithm.

4. WORKING PRINCIPLE :Merge Sort works using three main steps:

5. Divide:

Divide the given list into two equal halves. Continue dividing until each part contains only one element. 2. Conquer:

Sort each smaller part recursively.
6. Combine:

Compare the elements of both sorted halves. Merge them into a single sorted list. If timestamps are equal, select the element from the left half first to maintain stability. 5. SAMPLE INPUT Given orders:

Timestamp Order ID 105 O1 102 O2 105 O3 101 O4 102 O5 103 O6 6. STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION Step 1: Divide the orders

[105, 102, 105, 101, 102, 103]

Divide into:

Left: [105, 102, 105]

Right: [101, 102, 103]

Step 2: Divide further

Left side:

[105] [102, 105] [102] [105] Right side:

[101] [102, 103] [102] [103] Step 3: Merge the elements

Left side:

[102] + [105] = [102, 105] [105] + [102, 105] = [102, 105, 105] Right side:

[102] + [103] = [102, 103
